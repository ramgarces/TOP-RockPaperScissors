# TOP-RockPaperScissors

First JavaScript project from The Odin Project curriculum - building a Rock Paper Scissors game.

Doing this project was a great learning experience, and I love the way The Odin Project has structured it in a way where you have to go out and find some answers on your own. To be honest, I had to go back and look up some very easy things, but I was encouraged to see that it is not frowned upon while doing projects like these - nobody can memorize everything.

When I first started getting into the JavaScript for this project I was overcome
with an feeling of being overwhelmed, but I paused for a second and started
thinking about what I needed to do to make this project happen. I took a piece of paper and wrote out the steps of everything that needed to happen when a player goes through the game. Breaking down the entire process into smaller steps or smaller problems helped me get through the mental block of being overwhelmed. For instance, I started with a four step process for the entire game, and then I expanded on it and ended up with 18 different small problems that would be easier to tackle than one huge one.

Writing the functions and refactoring previous ones for this game was somewhat challenging at first, but once I got into the swing of things I knew which bits of code I could put into functions to help with clarity and save time.

Overall, I am happy with the way the code turned out and how the webpage looks.
